<h1>The best movies According to Monty</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Inglorious Basterds</h3>
<p>This one is my favourite movie of all time. It has plenty of good stuff, good actors and obviously a good story. I never thought that a nazi performance could be the best of the film.</p>

<h3>Interestellar</h3>
<p>It is probably the best sci-fiction movie of all time. Some people need to watch it twice to understand it.</p>

<h3>Shutter Island</h3>
<p>It has the best plot twist ever. Di Caprio has one of the best performance in this crazy Scorsesse film.</p>
